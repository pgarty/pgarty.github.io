        <h2>Mobile and Desktop</h2>
        <p>
            On this site, I need to make sure that the site looks good on mobile and desktop. If not, then some users will be left out in the cold and that's no good. We want all our visitors to feel welcomed.
        </p>

        <h2>The Big Issue</h2>
        <p>
            So, there are defaults for design, but what if I want to do something unconventional. How will I know if that's an okay thing to do?
        </p>

        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>
            An easy way to find out if your site makes sense to visitors is to find people in your target demographic and have them do surveys, interviews, and other forms of user testing. This can help ensure your product reaches its goal in an unbiased way.
